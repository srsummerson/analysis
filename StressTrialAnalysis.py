2. Regular (before stress) and unrewarded
3. Regular (after stress) and rewarded

Behavior:
- Fraction of selecting low vs high value target (reg vs stress trials)
- Rewards received for each selection
- Number of successful trials for each trial type (reg vs stress)
- Response time for each trial type, i.e time to successfully complete trial
Physiological:
- Distribution of IBIs for stress trials, regular trials before stress trials are introduced, and regular trials after stress 
  trials are introduced -- divide up between successful and unsuccessful trials
- Average pupil diameter during stress trials, regular trials before stress trials are introduced, and regular trials after stress 
  is introduced -- divide up between successful and unsuccessful trials
Neurological:
- Average power in different bands for all channels, divided up by target
